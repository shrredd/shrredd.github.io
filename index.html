      Shravan was most recently an Engineering Leader at Stripe. He grew Stripe Treasury from idea to 
      hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits, and led Issuingâ€™s integrations with half-a-dozen banks. 
      Previously, he was co-founder and CEO of <a
        href="http://pixelapse.com">Pixelapse</a>, a design collaboration company. 
      He grew the business to profitability and tens of thousands of designers on the platform. 
      The company was eventually acquired by Dropbox. Post-acquisition, Shravan led teams building Dropboxâ€™s suite of collaboration tools, including the "new Dropbox", file history and previews.
