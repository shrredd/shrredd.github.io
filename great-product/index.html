      <p class="lede">
        The difference between a basic prototype and a great product is a mile wide and just as deep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prototypes are cheap and easy to throw up very quickly. When you first start a new project,
        it's largely driven by the initial momentum of doing something brand new, that's never been
        done before. Since nothing has been built yet, it's freeing to have the ability to work on so
        many new distinct areas of the product. The progress feels rapid simply because you have no
        users. If your homepage doesn't render in Internet Explorer, who cares?! No one's using the
        site yet. If a button click fails randomly once every 100 times, it doesn't matter! There's
        no one to complain about it yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        That feeling of pure, unadulterated joy in creating a product is unmatched. Our brains are
        great at perceiving relative change. There's an instant dopamine reaction the second that
        first user signs up. "OMG, we're building something that someone actually wants to use!"
        Simply put, this is why starting new products, or a brand new codebase feels so gratifying.
        It's a dramatic break from our typical mundane routine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conversely, our brains are exceptionally poor at sustaining that high if the relative change
        or acceleration of progress doesn't continue. The same dopamine hit that we first received
        simply by having a single user sign up, quickly wears off. We now need ten people to sign up
        to elicit the exact same reaction. Then a hundred people. Then a thousand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Change in growth is what we can perceive and what feels like measurable progress. Minor
        changes like tweaking the text copy to make it easier for 0.01% of users to understand the
        product doesn't feel like true progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why there are so few, truly great products. The creator's brain is wired to chase the
        same sweeping macro level changes that so dramatically increased early growth when the product
        was first getting started. Paradoxically, it's the attention to detail &mdash; the minor
        tweaks, the selection of a red button over a blue one &mdash; that drives marginal growth.
        Each individual design change on its own feels inconsequential, but it's the collective sum of
        these changes that make the product more accessible to a broader swath of people. Simply put,
        this is why it's so difficult to create great product.
      </p>

      <p>
        So how do we fight this instinct? How do we train ourselves to focus on the incremental
        improvements that compound into something great? We need a framework &mdash; a way to
        prioritize what matters at each stage of a product's evolution.
      </p>

      <h2>Maslow's Hierarchy of Product Design</h2>

      <p>
        Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-known theory in psychology of the key ingredients
        necessary for a human to survive and thrive. It's often portrayed with the basic requirements
        for survival at the base of the pyramid &mdash; physiological needs like food, water, and
        sleep. A bit higher up the chain are personal safety, then slowly proceeding to love and
        belonging, self-esteem, and finally self-actualization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without any of the base layers, the subsequent higher layers have little impact on
        contributing to your overall well-being. It's only when the needs of each lower tier have been
        thoroughly satisfied that addressing the higher tiers has a meaningful impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Analogously, product design should be driven entirely by a hierarchy of user needs.
      </p>

          <strong>Functional</strong>
          <span>Does it do what it claimed to?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="pyramid-tier tier-useful">
          <strong>Useful</strong>
          <span>Does the product solve an actual need?</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Useful</h2>

      <p>
        A product being useful is defined very simply. If there is a non-negligible group of people
        who suffer from a particular problem and your product eliminates that problem, then it's
        useful. For this very reason, need-finding is the absolute first step in the product design
        process. If there isn't a pressing need for your product to exist, then it probably shouldn't.
      </p>

      <p>
        This seems intuitive, but every year there are hordes of companies that are started simply
        because the technology they've developed is innovative and novel, not because they've created
        a real-world solution to a problem. Pure technology definitely has its place. But it's within
        the R&amp;D division of a large company or in a lab at a research university, not as the
        primary product in a customer-oriented business.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Let's say you were in ancient China and decided to investigate the market of people getting
          wet in the rain. Your very first step would be to survey a number of people who were
          drenched in the rain and establish that they'd really much rather prefer to be dry when it
          rains. You've now come across a pressing problem that begs to be solved.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Functional</h2>

      <p>
        Now that we've found a problem that affects a valuable base of potential customers, our goal
        is to come up with a basic solution that obviates it. The next question is whether the product
        can actually be used in the way that it's intended.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          You've figured out that people are willing to pay for a device that protects them from the
          rain. Your first attempt at a solution is a simple plank of wood, that people hold over
          their heads to protect themselves from the rain. It's functional and solves the immediate
          issue, but has some lingering problems that we'll soon discover.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Reliable</h2>

      <p>
        Does the product work consistently for everyone? Is it error-free and do people feel assured
        that it will continue to work correctly? This is one of the hardest parts of building a great
        product. System reliability is a core user requirement for using a service, but admittedly
        it's the most unsexy part of product development. Every engineer worth their salt knows
        there's no such thing as "error-free" and there are always issues that could never have been
        predicted until they actually occur. The goal is to get as close as possible to this ideal
        state, by building a fault-tolerant, redundant system.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It turns out that a flat plank of wood isn't very good at consistently keeping people dry.
          If two people walk side by side, they get splashed by water droplets ricocheting off the
          other's plank. You head back to the drawing board and craft a concave curved piece of wood
          designed to have water droplets fall straight down. You call this innovative device an
          "umbrella."
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Intentional</h2>

      <p>
        Does the product do exactly what I intended in the manner that is most intuitive? Does
        clicking a button meet my expectations of what that button was supposed to do? Are pages
        organized correctly? Are actions clearly organized? Does each interaction logically follow
        from the previous point in the interface?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Your poor umbrella customers are still holding this curved piece of wood above their heads.
          You hear complaints that their arms are getting tired and they can't walk long distances
          with the umbrella. As an innovative product designer, you decide to add a handle that is
          vertically fixed to the centerpiece of the wood. You also decide to replace the heavy curved
          wood with a lightweight mosaic of leaves attached to a rigid bamboo frame. Holding the
          umbrella now feels much more natural and is suitable for long excursions. Your customers are
          delighted!
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Aesthetic</h2>

      <p>
        Does the aesthetic of the product match my internal measure for something well-designed? Is it
        pleasing to the eye? When the average person thinks of design, most likely it is this layer
        that they're referring to. As we've seen though, there are four underlying levels that need to
        be addressed in the evolution of a product before its visual aesthetic makes even the
        slightest bit of difference to a customer's needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is arguably the level of the hierarchy where your product can best differentiate itself.
        According to one
        <a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=7868">study</a>,
        electric shavers that were aesthetically appealing were able to command a 30% premium compared
        to a similar functionally equivalent shaver. People react instinctively to products based on
        their appearance. For this reason, visual design executed well can serve to help your product
        rise above the competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, visual design is still purely a surface-level judgment. If the product falls over the
        first time a user attempts to use it, then the aesthetic layer collapses in on itself.
      </p>

      <h2>Resisting the instinct</h2>

      <p>
        The contrast in the needs of a product's creator and its users should be clear. The product
        creator's natural instinct is to chase the same initial high she felt at the beginning of the
        product development process. The easiest way to do this is to simply tack on new features, as
        each feature feels like measurable progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        As product creators, we need to resist this instinct and reconcile our own needs with the
        diametrically opposite needs of our users. Maslow's hierarchy is useful as a framework to
        understand what parts of the product deserve the most attention at any point in time. For any
        product, there are a hundred different new features that design and development time could go
        towards. Great product design is not merely checking off each of these features but limiting
        our focus to a specific narrow problem that is most worth pursuing and then solving it
        thoroughly from the bottom upwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Solve each layer completely before discovering and addressing the next most pressing user
        problem. Great product design takes incredible focus and self-discipline to quiet our natural
        instinct to chase novelty. The next time you feel the urge to build a shiny new feature, ask
        yourself: have I truly nailed the fundamentals for the people already using what I've built?
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        Great products are not built by chasing the next dopamine hit. They are built by people
        who find satisfaction in the unsexy work of getting the basics right.
